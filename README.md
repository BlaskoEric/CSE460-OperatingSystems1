With Dr. Zemoudeh

# Project
Design and developing of a simple 16-bit operating system with 512B virtual memory using C++.

### Phase 1 (Assembler and VirtualMachine)
Assembler takes in assembly source code and produces an object file. The Virtual machine then executes the oject file. Results for each file are printed to an outfile

### Phase 2 (Assembler, VirtualMachine and OS)
Continuing from last phase, introducing a operating system which loads and runs multiple object files at once. There is no memory management in this phase so running to many programs will result in an error.

### Phase 3 (Paging)
Building on previous phases, introducing menory management. The two implemented methods include First in First out (FIFO) and Last resently used (LRU) methods.
